# Tom Hooper, Full Stack Software Engineer

I am a pragmatic problem solver with a curious mind. Whether at work, in my personal life, or my time as a volunteer firefighter, challenges are what I thrive on. I have professional experience using JavaScript, React.js and PHP to create robust and re-usable code. I have also explored other languages and frameworks including Node.js, Typescript and Python.
