I am a pragmatic problem solver with a curious mind. Whether at work, in my personal life, or my time as a volunteer firefighter, challenges are what I thrive on. I have professional experience using JavaScript, React.js and PHP to create robust and re-usable code. I have also explored other languages and frameworks including Node.js, Typescript and Python.

Having recently moved back to the UK after 8 years in New Zealand I am looking for a new challenge. I am currently seeking out a role where I can continue to develop my skills and knowledge, and where I can make a positive impact.
